# Dignicate-Guideline-iOS

## Abstract
This is an example structure for native-iOS development, created by _[Dignicate, LLC](https://dignicate.com)_ to prescribe in-house standard.
Also, we would share it as case studies based on real problems we often faced so far.

## Focus
The project focuses mainly on asynchronous data flow over layered structure such as _Model-View-ViewModel_ and so-called _Clean Architecture_.

## Out-scope
We do not mention: 
* Any of network interaction, detailed usage of libraries like Alamofire. Infrastructure such as fetching external data and sending them out of boundary, are all implemented by mock objects.
* User interface and design concerns.
* Detailed explanation of fundamental knowledge such as Swift, Object orientation, MVVM and Dependency injection.

## Getting Started
